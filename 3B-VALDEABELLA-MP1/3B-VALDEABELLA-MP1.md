### Introduction to AI and Knowledge Representation
**Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation**
- **What is AI?**: AI refers to machines designed to mimic human intelligence by performing tasks like learning and decision-making.
- **Why is Knowledge Representation important?**: Knowledge representation structures information in a way that AI can reason, learn, and make decisions efficiently.

### Types of Knowledge Representation
- **1. Semantic Networks**: 
  - Visual representation of knowledge using nodes (concepts) and edges (relationships).
  - Example: A network connecting symptoms (e.g., fever, cough) to diagnoses (e.g., flu, cold).
  
- **2. Frames**: 
  - Structured data about objects or situations, used in AI systems like expert systems. Example: A medical frame containing patient data (age, symptoms, etc.).

- **3. Logic-based Representations**: 
  - Represent knowledge through logical formulas and rules, like Propositional and Predicate Logic.

### Medical Diagnosis System: Case Study
- **Application**: AI in healthcare is widely used in medical diagnosis.
- **Knowledge Representation**: Systems often use **ontologies** (hierarchies of medical terms) and **decision trees** for reasoning.
- **Problem Addressed**: These AI systems help doctors by analyzing symptoms and suggesting possible conditions, speeding up diagnosis.

### Knowledge Representation Model for Diagnosing Disease
- **Problem**: Diagnosing a patient’s condition based on symptoms like fever and cough.
- **Model**: A **Semantic Network** that connects symptoms to diseases.
  - **Nodes**: Symptoms (e.g., “Fever,” “Cough”) and diseases (e.g., “Flu,” “COVID-19”).
  - **Edges**: Labeled edges (e.g., “causes,” “associated with”) showing relationships between symptoms and diseases.

### Conclusion
- Knowledge representation is crucial for AI systems to process and reason with information.
- It allows AI to **understand context**, **make decisions**, and **solve problems**.
- **Reflection**: This activity highlights how AI systems rely on structured knowledge to function effectively.
